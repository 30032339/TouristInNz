          <div class="fvideo videos3">
              <p><br><br>One of the best ways to see a new city is by seeing it from above, head across to St. Pierre Cathedral and climb the two tall towers that offer some pretty epic views across the city and Lake Geneva itself.
                One of the best things to remember is that the south tower is best to view in glorious sunny weather – its open air balcony makes it pretty special.<br><br><br> On the other hand, 
                if you’ve arrived on a pretty chilly (or wet) day, make sure to climb the north tower.The old town of Geneva is a pretty special place, filled with centuries of beautiful buildings, history, and culture that’s well worth a gander at! Make sure to plan your visit around lunch time
                 – there’s many little cafes and restaurants that are well worth popping in. Oh, don’t forget to take a little r&r on the longest bench in the world too! </p>
